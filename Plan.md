# Project Plan

## Goal
Look at how passenger traffic changed at six major airports between 2020
and 2024, and use Monte Carlo integration to show how more random points
leads to a better estimate under a Weibull curve.

## Needs
- R (tidyverse, knitr, patchwork)
- Airport data (hardcoded in the QMD with tribble)
- Quarto to render to PDF

## Steps
1. Put together the airport data in R
2. Make a table showing passengers per airport per year
3. Plot the trends over time as a line graph
4. Write the Monte Carlo simulation using runif and dweibull
5. Show the simulation at 4 different sample sizes side by side
6. Write up what the results mean in each section
7. Render to PDF and check it looks right

# Repository Plan

## Goal
Keep track of my work on HW 4.3 using GitHub properly, with branches,
issues, and commits that actually mean something.

## Needs
- Public GitHub repo
- A main branch and a dev branch
- Issues to track what still needs to be done
- Commits with clear messages
- A pull request once everything is ready

## Steps
1. Create the repo and write the README
2. Make a dev branch to do all the work on
3. Open issues for the main tasks
4. Upload files one at a time with descriptive commit messages
5. Close issues through commit descriptions
6. Open a pull request from dev to main
7. Merge once everything looks good
